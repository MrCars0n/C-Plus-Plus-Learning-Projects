//Hotel.cpp -- brief statement as to the file’s purpose -- See assignment below.
/*	Assignment Description
	The cost of renting a room at a hotel is, say $100.00 per night. For special occasions,
	such as a wedding or conference, the hotel offers a special discount as follows: If
	the number of rooms booked is at least 10, the discount is 10%; at least 20, the discount
	is 20%; and at least 30, the discount is 30%. Also if rooms are booked for at least three
	days, then there is an additional 5% discount.

	Write a program that
		- loads the cost of renting one room and the sales tax rate
			from an input file (provided),
		- prompts the user to enter the number of rooms booked, and
		- prompts the user to enter the number of days the rooms are booked.

	The program outputs to an output file named (output.dat)
		- the cost of renting one room,
		- the discount on each room as a percent,
		- the number of rooms booked,
		- the number of days the rooms are booked,
		- the total cost of the rooms,
		- the sales tax,
		- and the total billing amount.

	Your program must use appropriate named constants to store special values such as various discounts.
